## hl

a kanji highlighter

I wanted to see how many hy≈çgai kanji I was using in CY character names for the lulz, so I whipped up a .txt to .html converter.

### How to Run

To generate kanjidic-utf8.txt:

    ./conv.sh

To generate kls.txt:

    python3 cn.py

To generate an HTML file:

    python3 hl.py < in.txt > out.html
